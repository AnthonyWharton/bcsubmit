# Very Simple Example

This folder contains a very simple Hello World C program, with job file ready
for submission to BlueCrystal. 

**NOTE:** You should _really_ change the `USERNAME` field in the Makefile or
          you could be in for a sad time.

Usage (in this folder):

``` bash
$ make run
```

This should run and you will find your results in a folder called `results`.
When you're content with this little demo you can also run `make clean` to
keep things nice and tidy!
